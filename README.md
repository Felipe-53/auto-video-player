### A little background and the goal

In a certain course platform, to go through the video lessons you have to choose, click and play the videos one after the other: a very sensible default, actually. Auto-playing can be quite annoying, specially if you're doing a course. In that case, you're probably even pausing the video from time to time to take notes or test, practice, explore, etc.

But imagine you were requested to take a course on a topic you already master. It is good to review, but you won't be doing it as slowly as you would if that content was new to you. In that case, auto-playing could be quite handy.

Sadly, said platform didn't offer the auto-play feature.

Hence this project!

This automation uses pupuppeteer to auto-play the course videos sequentially a thoroughly (what a hard word to spell).
